# Image Manipulation and Analysis:

# Save an image of yourself and perform various manipulations:
Convert to grayscale.
Adjust contrast.
Increase brightness.
Add noise and reduce it using the Median filter.
Edge detection using Sobel and Canny operators.
Sharpen the image.
Blur the image using Gaussian and Average filters.
# Color Model Conversion and Histogram Analysis:

Convert the image to different color models and analyze.
Apply various filters to the grayscale version of the image.
Draw and compare histograms for grayscale and color images.
Equalize the histogram and convert the image to negative.
Image Format Analysis:

Analyze your main image (colored) considering format details, resolution, and compression type.
# Face Image Processing:

Capture and save images of your face in different conditions.
Use Template Matching and Histogram Matching to align and compare these images.
# MRI Image Analysis:

Analyze MRI images of different patients.
Draw histograms and identify abnormalities using threshold values.
Use an appropriate algorithm to detect abnormal regions.
